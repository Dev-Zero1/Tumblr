# Lab 1 - *Tumblr

**Tumblr** is a photo browsing app using the [The Tumblr API](https://www.tumblr.com/docs/en/api/v2#posts).

Time spent: **4.5** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** user stories are complete:

- [x] User can scroll through a feed of images returned from the Tumblr API (5pts)

The following **stretch** user stories are implemented:

- [ ] User sees an alert when there's a networking error (+1pt)
- [ ] While poster is being fetched, user see's a placeholder image (+1pt)
- [ ] User sees image transition for images coming from network, not when it is loaded from cache (+1pt)
- [ ] Customize the selection effect of the cell (+1pt)

The following **additional** user stories are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality! (+1-3pts)

Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):

1. More thorough Lab manual, parts are vague and leave you to "fill in the blanks" which would be fine if we had a year of swift under our belts
2. Better ways to troubleshoot logic errors &  GUI

## Video Walkthrough

Here's a walkthrough of implemented user stories:

## Notes

Unable to render photos, troubleshooting the request and display was most of the work!
Troubleshooting skills would be a helpful module to incorporate for future students. Things like testing output/connections/requests. Validating logic.

SIGBART missing components
View overlay was blocking the Nav bar!
